	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980},
	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Moreover, numerous studies in the literature have reported the correlation between diseases and the shortening (or lengthening) of 3 UTRs. As alternative polyA sites are common in mammalian genes, several machine learning tools have been published for predicting polyA sites from sequence data. These tools either consider limited sequence features or use relatively old algorithms for polyA site prediction.

	abstract = {Several statistical methods were tested for accuracy in predicting observed frequencies of di- through hexanucleotides in 74,444 bp of E. coli DNA. A Markov chain was most accurate overall, whereas other methods, including a random model based on mononucleotide frequencies, were very inaccurate. When ranked highest to lowest abundance, the observed frequencies of oligonucleotides up to six bases in length in E. coli DNA were highly asymmetric. All ordered abundance plots had a wide linear range containing the majority of the oligomers which deviated sharply at the high and low ends of the curves. In general, values predicted by a Markov chain closely followed the overall shape of the ordered abundance curves. A simple equation was derived by which the frequency of any nucleotide longer than four bases in the E. coli genome (or any genome) can be relatively accurately estimated from the nested set of component tri- and tetranucleotides by serial application of a 3rd order Markov chain. The equation yielded a mean ratio of 1.03 +/- 0.94 for the observed-to-expected frequencies of the 4,096 hexanucleotides. Hence, the method is a relatively accurate but not perfect predictor of the length in nucleotides between hexanucleotide sites. Higher accuracy can be achieved using a 4th order Markov chain and larger data sets. The high asymmetry in oligonucleotide abundance means that in the E. coli genome of 4.2 X 10(6) bp many relatively short sequences of 7-9 bp are very rare or absent.},

When the primary sequence is modeled as a spatially homogeneous Markov source, the fit to observed codon preference is very poor. The situation improves substantially when a non-homogeneous model is used. Some implications for the estimation of species phylogeny and substitution rates are discussed.},

	issn = {0092-8240},
	abstract = {The composition of naturally occurring DNA sequences is often strikingly heterogeneous. In this paper, the DNA sequence is viewed as a stochastic process with local compositional properties determined by the states of a hidden Markov chain. The model used is a discrete-state, discrete-outcome version of a general model for non-stationary time series proposed by Kitagawa (1987). A smoothing algorithm is described which can be used to reconstruct the hidden process and produce graphic displays of the compositional structure of a sequence. The problem of parameter estimation is approached using likelihood methods and an EM algorithm for approximating the maximum likelihood estimate is derived. The methods are applied to sequences from yeast mitochondrial DNA, human and mouse mitochondrial DNAs, a human X chromosomal fragment and the complete genome of bacteriophage lambda.},
